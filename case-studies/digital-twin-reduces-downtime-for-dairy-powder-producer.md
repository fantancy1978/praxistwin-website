# Case Study: How a Digital Twin Reduced Downtime by 40% for a Dairy Powder Producer

**The Client:** A leading dairy cooperative specializing in high-value infant formula powder.

**The Challenge:** The client was experiencing frequent, unscheduled production shutdowns due to excessive wall fouling in their primary spray dryer. Each shutdown required a full eight-hour cleaning cycle, resulting in significant production losses, wasted product, and inconsistent supply schedules. The root cause was identified as minor, but critical, variations in the viscosity and solid content of their incoming raw milk concentrate.

**The Solution: A Predictive Digital Twin**
We implemented a high-fidelity digital twin of their entire spray drying process. This virtual model was connected to real-time sensors not only on the dryer itself (temperature, pressure, airflow) but also to in-line analyzers monitoring the properties of the raw milk concentrate before it entered the dryer.

The system was put to the test when the in-line analyzer detected a 5% increase in the viscosity of an incoming batch of concentrate. The digital twin immediately ran a simulation and predicted that this specific batch would cause heavy wall fouling to begin within 90 minutes, leading to a mandatory shutdown within four hours.

Instead of reacting to the problem after it occurred, the system took proactive measures. The digital twin calculated a new set of optimized operating parameters to compensate for the higher viscosity—recommending a 3°C increase in the inlet air temperature and a 4-bar reduction in atomizer pressure. The operator was alerted with this clear recommendation and implemented the changes instantly.

**The Results:** The production run continued for its full 18-hour cycle without any significant fouling, preventing a costly shutdown. Over the first six months of implementation, the client achieved a **40% reduction in cleaning-related downtime**, a **15% increase in overall product yield**, and calculated annual savings exceeding €500,000. This case perfectly illustrates how a digital twin transforms operational data into predictable, profitable outcomes.
