# The ROI of Innovation: Building the Business Case for a Digital Architecture

*Published on July 2, 2025*

Traditional ROI models, designed for linear asset purchases, fundamentally fail when applied to foundational digital architectures, mistaking strategic imperatives for simple IT expenses and causing board-level rejections of critical transformation initiatives. **The Value Realization Frameworkâ„¢** addresses this gap by structuring value arguments across three pillars: Operational Value (immediate efficiency gains), Strategic Value (innovation acceleration and market responsiveness), and Competitive Value (durable competitive moats and quantified cost of inaction). By applying this sophisticated methodology, leaders transform their proposals from budget requests into data-driven mandates for market leadership, enabling confident investment decisions that secure competitive positioning in the digital economy.
